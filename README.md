## Abstract

SARS-CoV-2 induces widespread transcriptomic changes in host cells upon infection, in part through activation and modulation of innate immunity pathways leading to downstream gene regulation. However, the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 and its evolutionary variants differentially affect host cell transcriptomic states remain largely unclear. Through chromatin proteomic (iDAPT-MS) analysis, we found that although SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogenic coronaviruses exhibit similar proteomic shifts on chromatin, SARS-CoV-2 uniquely promotes TP53 nuclear accumulation and activation. Parallel assessment of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 viral protein expression on host chromatin states (ATAC-seq) identifies intracellular spike protein as a key determinant of virus-mediated chromatin accessibility changes. Multilevel chromatin profiling reveals increased TP53 nuclear accumulation, TP53-associated chromatin accessibility changes, and TP53 target gene activation upon expression of SARS-CoV-2 alpha (B.1.1.7) and delta (B.1.617.2) spike variants relative to the ancestral spike sequence. TP53, ACE2, and furin cleavage are required for these changes, driving decreased cellular proliferation, increased cellular senescence, and increased cytokine release. Finally, the omicron sublineage BA.1 but not sublineages BA.2, BA.2.12.1, nor BA.4/BA.5 spike expression leads to attenuated TP53 activity and fusogenicity relative to ancestral spike. Our findings implicate spike-mediated host TP53 activation as a “rheostat” of COVID-19 pathogenicity.
